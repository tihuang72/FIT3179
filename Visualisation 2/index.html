                <h1>The Need for <b class="renewables">Renewable </b> Energy</h1>
                <p>The use of fossil fuels - <b>coal, oil and natural gas</b> has been essential in the development
                    of society as we know it today. Fossil fuels are used to generate heat, power vehicles and to
                    generate
                    electricity amongst other many other uses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, fossil fuels are the primary cause of <b>greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions</b> which have been
                    linked
                    to <b>climate change, extreme weather conditions</b> and other changes in nature. Additionally, the
                    extraction, processing
                    and burning of fossil fuels has also caused air and water pollution. These impacts have accelerated
                    the need
                    to transition towards renewable energy.
                </p>
                <p>The scatter plot compares the amount of CO2 emissions in tonnes with the percentage of energy a
                    country generates
                    that is renewable. It describes the trend that <b class="renewables"> more renewable energy
                        generation leads
                        to less CO2 emissions </b>
                </p>
                <p>Historically Australia has been a large exporter of raw materials. This trend includes that of
                    fossil fuels with there being a coal and natural gas mining boom in the early 2000s. Australia's top
                    3 exports include iron ore,
                    coal and natural gas.
                </p>
                <p>The area chart on the right describes the export of fossil fuels in Australia over time.
                    <b>Australia exports ~75% of the energy</b> it generates.
                </p>
                <p>The <b>large increase in fossil fuel exports</b> has given rise to concern over its effect on the
                    emissions outside of Australia.</p>

                <p>
                    As part of the Paris Agreement, Australia pledged to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030 compared to
                    2005 levels and achieve net zero
                    emissions by 2050.

                <p>
                    Australia notably has increased energy generation from solar and wind. In 2023, renewable energy made
                    up a record 35% of all energy generated.

                <p> The <b>major areas of renewable energy growth</b> have been in the expansion of <b>wind and solar
                        energy</b>, particularly small-scale solar. Small-scale solar refers to solar energy systems
                    with a capacity of less than 1 MW, primarily including solar panels installed on residential
                    properties or businesses. </p>
                <p> Residential solar has been incentivized by the <b>Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme</b>, which
                    aims to
                    promote the installation of small-scale solar, wind, or hydro systems by <b>subsidizing</b> the
                    upfront
                    installation costs. </p>
                <p> The map highlights the <b>small-scale solar potential (MW)</b> in local government areas (LGAs) in
                    Australia, categorized
                    by solar energy sources. Additionally, the blue markers indicate the locations of <b>large-scale
                        solar
                        plants</b> currently operating in the eastern part of the country. </p>
                <p> Residential solar energy has <b style="color:rgb(255, 174, 0)">significant growth potential</b>,
                    driven by advancements in solar
                    technology and increasing adoption rates among Australian households. </p>
